        <h3>Why Buttered Noodles?</h3>
            <p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
            <p>You may be wondering: "Do I really need a recipe for buttered noodles?" The answer, of course, is yes. This kid-friendly recipe results in perfect noodles tossed in exactly the right amount of butter. Once you try these four-ingredient buttered noodles, you'll never go back to your old method again.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Noodles</li>
                    <p>This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.</p>
                <li>Butter</li>
                    <p>You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).</p>
                <li>Parmesan</li>
                    <p>Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.</p>
                <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
                    <p>Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.</p>
            </ul>
        <h4>Cooking Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>

                <li>Stir in fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. </li>
                <li>Drain and return pasta to pot. Mix butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper into pasta until evenly combined.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Cooks Notes</h4>
